Girls Who Code Fond du Lac 2018-2019 boilerplate website

1. Go to https://github.com/RogueGoat/girlswhocode (here)
2. Open your GIT Bash terminal - type in `cd Desktop/`
3. In your GIT Bash terminal type `git clone https://github.com/RogueGoat/girlswhocode.git your-name`
(This is telling github to funnel the remote repository onto your desktop into a new local directory! Remember to replace "your-name" with...your name ;) )
4. After your GIT Bash has completed the transfer - open up your new directory with Brackets
5. Have fun!

Important Git Commands: (Please only use the ones with * for now)

# git remote set-url origin (YOUR REMOTE ORIGIN) - I will send instructions on how to create this
# git push (push your work back upstream to the remote repository)
# git pull (pull work from your remote origin)
# git add _path/to/file.html_ (this tracks currently untracked files)
# git commit (this "saves" the files and adds a commit message - so you remember what you've been doing on that branch!)*
# git checkout _NAME_ (switch to a different branch)*
# git checkout -b _NAME_ (make a new branch from your current branch!)*
# git status (check on the status of your files, whether you have a clean tree or untracked work)*
