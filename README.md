Girls Who Code Fond du Lac 2018-2019 boilerplate website

1. Go to https://github.com/RogueGoat/girlswhocode (here)
2. Open your GIT Bash terminal - type in cd Desktop/
3. In your GIT Bash terminal type “git clone https://github.com/RogueGoat/girlswhocode.git your-name”
(This is telling github to funnel the remote repository onto your desktop into a new local directory! Remember to replace "your-name" with...your name ;) )
4. After your GIT Bash has completed the transfer - open up your new directory with Brackets
5. Have fun!
